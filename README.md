# Tweet Processing: Graphika Data Engineer Take-Home 
Processing Tweets as a nightly job. 

## Requirments
Data (nodes1.txt, nodes2.txt, terms1.txt, terms2.txt, tweets.jsonl.gz)

Python 3.7 (a lower 3.x version might work but that's what I used)

The two Python pacakges that a fresh install will not have are `pandas` and `apscheduler` 

Here is one way to install them:

```shell
$ python3 -m pip install --user pandas
$ python3 -m pip install --user apscheduler
```
